        <div>
            This Cookie Policy explains how our website (the "Site") uses cookies, web beacons, and
            other similar technologies to collect information about users who visit our site. We use

            <h1>What are cookies?</h1>

            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you
            visit a website. They allow the website to remember your actions and preferences over a
            period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the
            site or browse from one page to another.

            <br /><br />
            <h1>What cookies do we use?</h1>

            We use both first-party and third-party cookies on our Site. First-party cookies are set
            by the website you are visiting, while third-party cookies are set by a domain other
            than the one you are visiting. We use Google AdSense to serve advertisements on our
            Site, which may also set cookies to provide relevant ads to users based on their visit
            to our site and other sites on the Internet. The types of cookies we use on our Site
            include:

            <!--        <br><br>-->
            <span>Functional cookies:</span> These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you

            features.
            <br /><br />
            <span>Targeting cookies:</span> These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is
            relevant to your interests. They may be used to limit the number of times you see an
            advertisement, as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.
